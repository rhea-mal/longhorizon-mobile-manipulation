## Overview

We build a long horizon **HoMeR** (Hybrid Whole-Body Policies for Mobile Robots) as an a hybrid imitation learning framework for mobile manipulation. It combines KISA automated keyframe and keypoint labeling with whole-body control with a hybrid action representation to achieve generalizable and precise robot behavior in both simulation and real-world settings.

### 🖥️ Simulation-Only

If you are **only using simulation**, refer to:

📄 [`SIM.md`](SIM.md)

This guide covers:
- Conda setup on macOS and Linux
- Simulated data collection and annotation
- Training and evaluating HoMeR and baselines in simulation

---

### 🤖 Real-World

📄 [`REAL.md`](REAL.md)

This guide covers:
- Hardware and software setup for real-world deployment
- Real-world data collection and annotation
- Training and evaluating HoMeR and baselines in real
